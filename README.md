Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?

Customers come in various types—single, married, with kids, and belonging to different age groups, income levels, and professions. Additionally, their habits, such as how often they eat out or visit bars, influence their coupon usage.

Let’s first examine which types of customers use coupons more frequently and the kinds of coupons they prefer.

This graph shows that the younger population is more likely to use coupons for coffee, carryout, and inexpensive restaurants. Coupon usage in bars is low, and overall, every age group uses coupons for more expensive restaurants minimally. Coupon usage decreases proportionally with age. Interestingly, individuals over 50 use coupons at a rate similar to their 30-year-old counterparts.

This graph also shows that individuals with a middle income range of $25K to $62K are more likely to use coupons. This trend aligns with the age group preferences for coffee, carryout, and inexpensive restaurants. Coupon usage in bars is low, and overall, every income group minimally uses coupons for more expensive restaurants. Coupon usage decreases proportionally with income. Interestingly, individuals earning over $100K use coupons at a rate similar to those in the middle-income range.
