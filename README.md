Will a customer accept the coupon?


Customers are of different types, single, married, with kids, different age groups, income level and profession. Then are their habits, how many time they eat out and go to bar etc. 

First let see which type uses the coupon more and what kind of coupon.

This graph shows that the younger population is more likely to use coupons for coffee, carryout, and inexpensive restaurants. Coupon usage in bars is low, and overall, every age group uses coupons for more expensive restaurants minimally. Coupon usage decreases proportionally with age. Interestingly, individuals over 50 use coupons at a rate similar to their 30-year-old counterparts.

This graph also shows that individuals with a middle income range of $25K to $62K are more likely to use coupons. This trend aligns with the age group preferences for coffee, carryout, and inexpensive restaurants. Coupon usage in bars is low, and overall, every income group minimally uses coupons for more expensive restaurants. Coupon usage decreases proportionally with income. Interestingly, individuals earning over $100K use coupons at a rate similar to those in the middle-income range.
