Please find the code here: https://github.com/MRiDeb/Coupon/blob/main/prompt.ipynb

Customers come in various types—single, married, with kids, and belonging to different age groups, income levels, and professions. Additionally, their habits, such as how often they eat out or visit bars, influence their coupon usage.

Let’s first examine which types of customers use coupons more frequently and the kinds of coupons they prefer.

By Age:  ![ByAge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0e32935-5dd2-4606-ad03-a0f9f1f0a263)

This graph shows that the younger population is more likely to use coupons for coffee, carryout, and inexpensive restaurants. Coupon usage in bars is low, and overall, every age group uses coupons for more expensive restaurants minimally. Coupon usage decreases proportionally with age. Interestingly, individuals over 50 use coupons at a rate similar to their 30-year-old counterparts. 

By Income:  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d1607b-beeb-4d7c-90e8-a9dcf709d504)

This graph also shows that individuals with a middle income range of $25K to $62K are more likely to use coupons. This trend aligns with the age group preferences for coffee, carryout, and inexpensive restaurants. Coupon usage in bars is low, and overall, every income group minimally uses coupons for more expensive restaurants. Coupon usage decreases proportionally with income. Interestingly, individuals earning over $100K use coupons at a rate similar to those in the middle-income range. 

By Education:  ![Byeducation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e414caf-0992-4270-bc67-64d87071238c)

This is an interesting graph. It shows that people with some college education (including Bachelor's and Master's degrees) are more likely to use a coupon.

By Gender: ![ByGender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6920dafa-3f95-42a8-b9d1-b06edb7dd490)

No major difference

Has Children: ![Byhas_children](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e472a3f0-941f-4658-823a-c2e3935e216a)

People who do not have children tend to use coupons more often.

By Marital Status: ![BymaritalStatus](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3346292b-c3e2-4be0-a582-3678d4a8065d)

This graph shows that Single and Married couples use more coupons.

By Occupation: ![Byoccupation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3babdd13-eba8-48e8-a207-444c99ee55c8)

This is very interesting, is it that the Unemployed and students have more time to take the survey? in any case they are the one's using the coupons the most.

Now let see what is the affect of Contextual attributes: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97ad1f60-b24f-4815-947e-49fd4d43492e)

Form the graphs, it is clear that person will most likely use a coupon when it is Sunny, warmer weather, going to a non-urgent place along or with friends. Evening and coupons with one-day validity will be more than like be used.

Now let see what is the affect of number of time a service is used by the costomer: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59cef9ac-71ed-4c08-8be2-25ae4425132f)

Overall we see a tendancy that a person who goes to a place more offen uses less coupons. Still most coupons are used at coffee house. People who go 1 to 3 times to any place used most coupons expect the high end resturant, where only first timer uses the most coupons.
